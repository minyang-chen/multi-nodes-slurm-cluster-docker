Using job dependencies for pipeline stages (e.g., data preprocessing → training → evaluation)
You can use the--dependency flag to set job dependencies. This ensures that a job only runs after the specified conditions are met.


$ --dependency=<type:job_id> # where type can be after, afterany, afterok etc.

For example, in a usual ML pipeline we have these stages:
Preprocessing: sbatch preprocessing_job.sh which gets assigned the 1234 job ID.
Model training: sbatch --dependency=afterok:1234 training_job.sh
Model evaluation: sbatch --dependency=afterok:1235 evaluation_job.sh
